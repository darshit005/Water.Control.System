#💧 IoT-Based Water Control System
This project is a complete IoT solution for monitoring and controlling a water system using an ESP32 microcontroller and a custom-built Android app. 
The system provides real-time data on water level, flow rate, motor speed, and water volume, and allows wireless control via Wi-Fi. 
A custom PCB was designed in Altium Designer to bring everything together in a compact, reliable form.

#🔧 Features
